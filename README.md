# CAIRN – Collaborative AI Artifact Record & Notation

CAIRN is a lightweight, standards-aligned framework for documenting AI-assisted content creation.  
It captures the contributions of both human and AI participants, ensuring transparency, traceability, and accountability.

CAIRN supports provenance, prompt fidelity, references, lifecycle states, multi-agent collaboration, and audit-ready records—making it ideal for regulatory, scientific, engineering, and legal use cases.
