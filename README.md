# CAIRN: Collaborative AI Artifact Record & Notation

> A transparent, interoperable metadata framework for tracking AI-generated content from prompt to publication.

---

## 🌍 Why CAIRN?

As AI systems become integrated into every domain—from law to science to journalism—CAIRN ensures we can **trace, verify, and trust** what was generated, by whom, with which tools, and why.

CAIRN makes AI output:
- ✅ Accountable
- ✅ Auditable
- ✅ Interoperable across platforms and jurisdictions

It’s like **version control + authorship tracking + metadata transparency** for the AI age.

## 📐 What Is CAIRN?

CAIRN is a JSON-LD–based metadata model that captures:
- Original prompts and AI system responses
- Human and AI authors, editors, reviewers, and approvers
- Language, encoding, and content maturity (alpha, beta, final)
- Provenance of external sources and citations
- Many-to-many dialog graphs across systems
